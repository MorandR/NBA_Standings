# NBA Tournament

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Basketball Introduction</h3>

In this project we will use machine learning models in order to predict the winners of each game and ultimately the tournament. We will be using data that includes the following:players stats, historical data, and team performance metrics. Our goal is to be as accurate as possible using these datasets and ultimately make the best prediction for the winner of the tournament. 

**Data collection:** 
We will be gathering data from sports websites from this recent seasons; maybe the latest 2 seasons. The data that we gather will include stats like, points, rebounds, assists, match ups, and results of previous matches. 
Since no data was compiled of recent seasons, we may do our own compilation manually. 
To expedite the task for adding more data to the dataset, we are thinking of incorporating (web scraping) spider to create a table in excel using data displayed on the initial site.

**Data Preprocessing:**
 Before proceeding we will be organizing the data to make sure the data is clean and easy to analyze.

**Models:**
We will be creating different models to predict the probability of each team winning. Using different features in the dataset, each model will judge the wins of each team.
Number of regression models is currently 4, with each containing different set of hidden layers
Since we are still predicting the winner of the tournament, we want to use pre-existing data for our models to learn from and predict which team(s) has a higher chance of winner the entire tournament,

**Analysis and Figures:**
Since each model will have its own factors to predict the win rate of each team, we will analyze the differences based on their actual win rate.
There will be correlation between the features and should tell us whether they are helpful or a drawback to a team winning.
Charts would display which model has a better prediction on win rates based on their selected features.

**Possible experimentations:**
We may tweak certain parameters and hyperparameters to develop better model presentation.
As we dive into more research, there are possible algorithms that we may come across and would be intriguing to use aside from those used within the course.
More analysis will be explored while going through this experimentation.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
We want to showcase the powerful tool of machine learning by leveraging data and different techniques used for prediction. Those predictions can later be used to make accurate conclusions.
